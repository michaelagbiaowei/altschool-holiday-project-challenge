## **ALTSCHOOL AFRICA**

## **Holiday Project**

## You are required to perform the following tasks

- Set up 2 EC2 instances on AWS(use the free tier instances).

- Deploy an Nginx web server on these instances(you are free to use Ansible)

- Set up an ALB(Application Load balancer) to route requests to your EC2 instances

- Make sure that each server displays its own Hostname or IP address. You can use any programming language of your choice to display this.

- Work on building a personal portfolio and CV (Check out resumeworded.com).

## Important points to not

- I should not be able to access your web servers through their respective IP addresses. Access must be only via the load balancer

- You should define a logical network on the cloud for your servers.

- Your EC2 instances must be launched in a private network.

- Your Instances should not be assigned public IP addresses.

- You may or may not set up auto scaling(I advice you do for knowledge sake)

- You must submit a custom domain name(from a domain provider e.g. Route53) or the ALBâ€™ domain name.
